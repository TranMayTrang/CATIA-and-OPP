 
  Object-oriented programming
 ==================================
 
	Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: 
	data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
	A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself (objects have a notion of this or self). 
	In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular 
	ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types. 
 
 CATIA
============
	CATIA, an acronym of computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application) is a multi-platform software suite for computer-aided design (CAD), 
	computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), computer-aided engineering (CAE), PLM and 3D, developed by the French company Dassault Systèmes.
	Since it supports multiple stages of product development from conceptualization, design and engineering to manufacturing, it is considered a 
	CAx-software and is sometimes referred to as a 3D Product Lifecycle Management software suite. Like most of its competition it facilitates 
	collaborative engineering through an integrated cloud service and have support to be used across disciplines including surfacing & shape design,
	electrical, fluid and electronic systems design, mechanical engineering and systems engineering.
	Besides being used in a wide range of industries from aerospace and defence to packaging design, CATIA has been used by architect Frank Gehry 
	to design some of his signum curvilinear buildings and his company Gehry Technologies was developing their Digital Project software based on CATIA.

#### CATIA Input data include:

CATIA support many kinds of file extensions:

	.CATPart (Room)
	.CATProduct (Assembly)
	.CATDrawing (drawing)
	.cgr (faceted representation)
	.3dxml (Lightened representation)
	The native or neutral formats supported by Catia V5 are Catia V4, IGES, DXF, DWG, STEP, STL. Catia V5 
	Downgrade compatibility tool alow to convert Catia V5 models to a lower release but with some limitation : 
	assembly not supported, multisolid not supported, some special entities not supported, parametric information lost.

## Setup

	We need to follow step by step guideline to setup CATIA on your computer:
	Here is an example of the screen setup when we install CATIA software:

		Welcome to the CATIA V5R18 Setup program.
		This program will install CATIA V5R18 on your computer.
		Click Cancel to quite Setup, Click ext to continue.

## Usage

	-* We can create a new design or continue with old version of the files.
	-* Some basic components are: Points; Lines; Plane; Cycles; Paramids; Surfaces...
	-* Some basic methods are: Extrude the sketchs to create a 3D component, find the intersections, Extend elements...

## Create a sample notation in CATIA

	// Create a base sketch: contain Circles, lines, spline and then add some dimensions...
	// Extrude the sketch to have the third dimenson for part (the  to create a 3D component)...
	// Create another sketch on the surfaces that lie on the 3D component..
	// Extrude to create another 3D component.
	// Modify the sketches or the extrude dimensons to have a suitable design
	// Checking with another designer to complete the structures.
